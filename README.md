# Stonestory RPG Stonescript Manual

A [vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/) manual for the Stonescript language used in
[Stonestory RPG](https://stonestoryrpg.com/)

I created this because I wanted an easier way to search the documentation for stonescript,
including searches (ctr/cmd + k) and linking specific sections
